    TODO revise documentation
    While the results of searches and diff are individual paths through the object tree
    (a search result basically gives you directions through the object tree until you arrive
    at your destination -- the object containing your search value;
    any single diff result gives you directions through both an left-hand and and right-hand object
    tree until you arrive at the point where those two diverge)
    hashing means traversing the whole tree.
    This means that a HashLevel always contains one single obj -- the object of the tree
    we're currently looking at -- but provides any number of child_rels.
    It also means there is just a single up, but any number of down's.
    And here's where it start to get ugly so I just mark it with TODO
    #
    # - A single chain of *SearchLevel* objects represents a single path through a single object tree,
    #   leading from to root up to an object matching the search criteria.
    #   - Therefore, a SearchTreeResult contains all of those paths which lead to matching objects.
    # - A single chain of *DiffLevel* objects represents a single path through two similar
    #   object trees, from the root up a point where they diverge.
    #   - Therefore, a DiffTreeResult contains all of those paths, each ending at a point where the
    #     payload trees t1 and t2 diverge.
    # - A chain of *HashLevel* objects denotes just any path through the object tree
    #   from the root to any leaf.
    #   At all points where the payload object tree branches this chain references
    #   (.right) another chain that represents a path to another
    #   leaf. This other chain will again reference additional chains wherever this
    #   subtree branches.
    #   To conserve memory, we'll only keep one complete root-to-leaf HashLevel chain
    #   and the others will just start at their branching point.
    #   As replacement there's a .left at the top of a diverging chain that brings you back to the original one
    #   which should have a .up
    #   - Therefore, a HashTreeResult contains just a single HashLevel "chain", which as explained
    #     is not really a single chain at all but a tree itself.
